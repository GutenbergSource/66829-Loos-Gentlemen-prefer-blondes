<HTML><BODY><i>Gentlemen Prefer Blondes: The Illuminating Diary of a Professional Lady</i>, began as a series of short sketches published in <i>Harper's Bazaar</i>, known as the "Lorelei" stories. They were satires on the state of sexual relations that only vaguely alluded to sexual intimacy; the magazine's circulation quadrupled overnight. The heroine of the stories, Lorelei Lee, was a bold, ambitious flapper, who was much more concerned with collecting expensive baubles from her conquests than any marriage licenses, in addition to being a shrewd woman of loose morals and high self-esteem. She was a practical young woman who had internalized the materialism of the United States in the 1920s and equated culture with cold cash and tangible assets.

<p>The success of the short stories had the public clamoring for them in book form. Pushed by Mencken, she signed with Boni &amp; Liveright. Modestly published in November 1925, the first printing sold out overnight. The initial reviews were rather bland and unimpressive, but through word of mouth it became the surprise best-seller of 1925. Loos garnered fan letters from fellow authors William Faulkner, Aldous Huxley and Edith Wharton, among others. "Blondes" would see three more printings, sell through by year's end and 20 more in its first decade. The little book would see 85 editions in the years to come and eventually be translated into 14 languages, including Chinese.

</p><p>When asked who the models for her characters were, Loos would almost always say they were composites of various people. But when pressed, admitted that toothless flirt Sir Francis Beekman was modeled after writer Joseph Hergesheimer and producer Jesse L. Lasky. Dorothy Shaw was modeled after herself and Constance Talmadge and Lorelei most closely resembled acquisitive Ziegfeld showgirl, Lillian Lorraine, who was always looking for new places to display the diamonds bestowed by her suitors.

</p><p>The book was turned into a play, and into well-known movie in 1953, also known for the song "Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend".

</p><p>From a textual point of view this is a fairly easy work, so have fun!
